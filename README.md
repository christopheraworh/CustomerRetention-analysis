This project is all about understanding **customer retention** using
cohort analysis.\
I worked with the **UCI Online Retail Dataset** and explored how
customers behave over time after their very first purchase.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸŒŸ What this project does

-   Loads the **Online Retail dataset** directly from the UCI Machine
    Learning Repository.\
-   Cleans up the data (removing missing customer IDs, fixing dates).\
-   Groups customers into **cohorts** based on when they first
    purchased.\
-   Tracks those cohorts month by month to see how many people kept
    coming back.\
-   Visualizes everything with **heatmaps** (counts and percentages).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ›  Tools I used

-   **Python** (Pandas, Numpy) for data wrangling\
-   **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for plots\
-   **ucimlrepo** to fetch the dataset from UCI

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ”‘ Key steps in the analysis

1.  **Create InvoiceMonth and CohortMonth** â†’ figure out when each
    customer made their first order.\
2.  **Work out Cohort Index** â†’ number of months since that first
    order.\
3.  **Build a retention table** â†’ how many customers from each cohort
    came back in later months.\
4.  **Visualize it** â†’ heatmaps that show the retention story clearly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ðŸ“Š What the results show

-   Retention naturally drops off over time.\
-   Some cohorts stick around longer than others.\
-   You can spot when churn happens faster and use this to guide
    decisions on marketing or product strategy.
